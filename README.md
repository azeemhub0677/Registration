Registration Form
This project is a simple Registration Form built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. The form allows users to register by entering their personal details, which are then validated on both the client-side (using JavaScript) and server-side (using PHP).

Features
Frontend:

Built with HTML for structure and CSS for styling.
Responsive design to ensure a great user experience on all devices.
JavaScript for real-time form validation (e.g., checking if the email is in the correct format, password strength, etc.).
Backend:

PHP is used for server-side validation and processing of form submissions.
User data is securely handled with validation to prevent SQL injection and other common vulnerabilities.
Data can be stored in a database (e.g., MySQL) after successful validation.
Error Handling:

Displays error messages for invalid or missing input fields.
Ensures all required fields are filled before allowing form submission.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure and layout of the form.
CSS: Styling and responsiveness.
JavaScript: Client-side form validation.
PHP: Server-side form validation and data handling.
